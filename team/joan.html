    <p>We go to The Bronx Zoo for the beautiful, funny and attention grabbing animals of course but new this year are the Treetop Adventure and Nature Trek.</p>
    
    <p>The Treetop Adventure zips you 50 feet above the Bronx River for 400 feet before sending you back for the return trip.</p>
    
    <p>The Nature Trek for all ages includes family-friendly netted bridge-and-tower course featuring five towers that are up to two stories high and connected by  12 different bridges spanning up to 30 feet. The trek requires balancing on narrow beams, weaving between vertical barriers, stretching across wide steps, and climbing on wiggling surfaces.</p>
