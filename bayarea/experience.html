        <div class="write">
            There are so many beautiful experiences to have in the Bay Area. This part of California consists of nine counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma. This area alone has both metropolitan nightlife, as well as natural activies. If you travel north to the Napa region, you can partake in hot air ballon rides with some breathtaking views of wine country. Travel south and you can take long winding hikes and get lost in some of the most beautiful redwood tree forests in the United States. If you find yourself craving the city life, explore the famous Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
